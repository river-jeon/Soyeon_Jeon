Hi, my name is Soyeon Jeon.  

I like being surrounded by ideas, unexpected questions, and moments that demand curiosity. I do what excites me, often with too much energy, and avoid what doesn’t. I like the kind of academic freedom where you work seven days a week, but you choose which seven. 

My research integrates computational modeling, media analysis, and political behavior through vision-language models and multimodal data analysis. While computational social science serves as my primary methodological foundation, particularly for studying political communication, my methodological roots trace back to qualitative research. I am proficient in interviews, focus group studies, participant observation, and discourse analysis, having applied these methods in two key research contexts: examining the realization of people's sovereignty through NGO work and studying participatory budgeting systems.

My central focus these days is understanding the mechanisms driving citizen behavioral change, specifically how digital media, imagery, and audio content influence public opinion and political action, alongside implementing large models into social science research with an emphasis on debiasing. I study how people process information online, how campaigns persuade (or fail), and how everyday citizens make sense of politics and the world. I'm increasingly exploring multimodal methods that integrate text, image, and sound.

Movies, dramas, and animations provide a mental reset for me. Although I don't consider myself a public intellectual, I'm deeply committed to conducting research with public relevance.
