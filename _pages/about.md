Hi, my name is Soyeon Jeon.  

I like being surrounded by ideas, unexpected questions, and moments that demand curiosity. I do what excites me, often with too much energy, and avoid what doesn’t. I like the kind of academic freedom where you work seven days a week, but you choose which seven. You’ll usually find me somewhere between code and equations, toggling tabs between vision-language models, media content, and voters' decisions.  

Computational social science is my main toolkit, especially when it comes to political communication. However, I’ve also wandered into city halls with notebooks, worked alongside grassroots activists, and sat through more participatory budgeting meetings than I can count. I care deeply about the mechanics of citizens' behavioral changes, especially how digital media, visuals, and sound shape what people believe and how they act.

I’m currently thinking a lot about how vision-language models interpret political content, and what that means for bias, mediation, and the messy work of public opinion. I study how people process information online, how campaigns persuade (or fail), and how everyday citizens make sense of the noise. Multimodal methods that combine text, image, and sound are becoming my playground.

Movies, dramas, and animations keep me balanced. I go to the gym more out of duty than passion. I’m not a public intellectual, but I believe deeply in the importance of public relevance. I’m methodologically rigorous and cross-disciplinary by nature, and I'm still figuring it all out.
